The following code examples are provided:
   A breadth-first search graph traversal - a toy project a did in the winter of 2019.
   An infix to postfix expression converter using data structures from Spring 2017 - my coding has improved very significantly. 
   A linked list implementation using pointers which was recently cleaned up.
